# Python Projects

This repository contains selected Python projects focused on applied
data science, natural language processing (NLP), exploratory data
analysis (EDA), and automation. Each project emphasizes clear analytical
workflows, thoughtful visualization, and real-world data challenges.

## Featured Project

### Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis

Exploratory analysis of sentiment dynamics in Bitcoin-related tweets
using VADER compound sentiment scores. This project focuses on
understanding highly imbalanced sentiment distributions and surfacing
rare but extreme emotional responses through log-scaled visualization.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Sentiment analysis with VADER
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Log-scaled visualization for skewed distributions
- Analytical interpretation of social media data

## Why This Matters

Sentiment data is often dominated by neutral expressions, which can
mask meaningful but infrequent emotional extremes. This project shows
how careful exploratory analysis and visualization choices can uncover
signals that are relevant for downstream modeling, risk analysis, and
event-driven insights.
