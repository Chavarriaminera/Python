# Python Projects

This repository contains selected Python projects focused on
data analysis, NLP, automation, and exploratory data analysis.

## Featured Project
### Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis
Exploratory analysis of Bitcoin-related tweets using VADER compound
sentiment scores. Includes log-scaled visualizations to surface rare
extreme sentiment events.
### Why This Matters
Sentiment data is highly imbalanced toward neutral expressions.
Using a log-scaled visualization allows rare but extreme emotional
responses to remain visible, which is critical for downstream
modeling and event-driven analysis.
